## Introduction

Theft detection is crucial for maintaining security and preventing loss in various domains. The Theft Detection Algorithm leverages machine learning techniques to automatically identify shoplifting activities in video data. By combining data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building, the algorithm aims to provide an effective solution for theft detection.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: Load and preprocess video data for model training.
- Feature engineering: Extract relevant features from video frames to identify shoplifting activities.
- Model selection: Implement transfer learning using pre-trained models for theft detection.
- Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, recall, and F1 score.
- Confusion matrix: Visualize model predictions and true labels to understand performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/theft-detection.git
